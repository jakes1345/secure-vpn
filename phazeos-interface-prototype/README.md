# PhazeOS Interface Prototype

## What This Is

A **proof-of-concept** for PhazeOS's revolutionary intent-based interface.

Instead of:
- ❌ Learning commands (`pacman -S firefox`)
- ❌ Navigating menus (Settings → Display → Brightness)
- ❌ Remembering file paths (`/home/jack/Documents/resume.pdf`)

You just:
- ✅ Say what you want: "install firefox", "open my photos", "make screen brighter"

## Try It

```bash
cd phazeos-interface-prototype
python3 main.py
```

Then try:
- `install firefox`
- `open terminal`
- `find my documents`
- `make screen brighter`
- `what is using cpu`

## Next Steps

1. **Build GUI version** (Qt/GTK) - visual cards interface
2. **Add voice input** - speak instead of type
3. **Add gesture support** - swipe, pinch, etc.
4. **3D spatial interface** - WebGL/OpenGL
5. **Context engine** - learns your patterns
6. **File content search** - find by what's inside, not name

## The Vision

**You shouldn't need to learn an OS. The OS should learn you.**

This is just the beginning. 🚀
