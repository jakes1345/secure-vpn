## ⚠️ MINOR WARNINGS (Non-Critical)

These warnings are logged but don't affect functionality:

1. **vpn_manager module not found** - Expected, using environment variables instead
2. **FLASK_SECRET_KEY not set** - Using temporary key (works fine, but can be set for extra security)
3. **Dependency conflicts** (cryptography version) - Doesn't affect operation

These are cosmetic and don't impact the production deployment.
