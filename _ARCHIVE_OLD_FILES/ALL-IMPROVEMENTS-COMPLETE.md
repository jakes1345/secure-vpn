## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# For new installations
mysql -u root -p < web-portal/mysql_setup.sql

# For existing installations
mysql -u phazevpn -p phazevpn < web-portal/add_email_verification_columns.sql
```

### 2. Setup Automated Backups
```bash
sudo bash web-portal/setup_automated_backups.sh
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for production
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY="$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))')"
export MYSQL_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
export VPN_SERVER_IP="phazevpn.com"
export VPN_SERVER_PORT="1194"
```

### 4. Verify Installation
