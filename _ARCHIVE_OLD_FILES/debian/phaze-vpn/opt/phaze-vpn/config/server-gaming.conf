# PhazeVPN - GAMING/STREAMING OPTIMIZED Configuration
# Ultra-low latency, high throughput for gaming and streaming
# Based on OpenVPN with maximum performance tuning

# Server Configuration
port 1194
proto udp
dev tun
topology subnet
server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0

# PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZED ENCRYPTION
# AES-256-GCM is faster than ChaCha20 for gaming (better CPU optimization)
# ChaCha20 is better for mobile/ARM, but AES-256-GCM wins on x86_64
data-ciphers AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM:CHACHA20-POLY1305
cipher AES-256-GCM
auth SHA256  # SHA256 is faster than SHA512 with same security for VPN
tls-version-min 1.2  # TLS 1.2 is faster than 1.3 for gaming

# Perfect Forward Secrecy - Optimized
dh certs/dh2048.pem  # 2048-bit is faster than 4096, still secure
tls-groups secp256r1  # secp256r1 is faster than secp521r1, still secure

# Certificate Configuration
ca certs/ca.crt
cert certs/server.crt
key certs/server.key
tls-auth certs/ta.key 0

# Security Hardening
persist-key
persist-tun
remote-cert-tls client

# GAMING/STREAMING PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
# Maximum throughput, minimum latency
tun-mtu 1500
mssfix 1440  # Slightly larger for better throughput
# Larger buffers for high-speed connections
sndbuf 4194304  # 4MB send buffer (was 2MB)
rcvbuf 4194304  # 4MB receive buffer (was 2MB)

# Disable compression for gaming (adds latency)
comp-lzo no
push "comp-lzo no"

# Optimize keepalive for gaming (faster reconnection)
keepalive 5 30  # Shorter intervals for faster detection

# Disable fragmenting for gaming (reduces latency)
# fragment 1300  # DISABLED - adds latency
# mssfix 1200    # DISABLED - reduces throughput

# DNS - Fast DNS for gaming
push "dhcp-option DNS 1.1.1.1"  # Cloudflare (fastest)
push "dhcp-option DNS 1.0.0.1"
push "block-outside-dns"
push "redirect-gateway def1"

# IPv6 - Disable for gaming (reduces overhead)
push "block-ipv6"
push "dhcp-option DNS6 ::"

# Connection Limits - Higher for gaming servers
max-clients 500

# Logging - Minimal for performance
verb 1  # Minimal logging
mute 10

# Memory Protection
mlock

# Real-time Monitoring (lightweight)
status-version 2
status /tmp/openvpn-status-gaming.log 5

# Advanced Performance
# Disable client-to-client for better isolation and performance
# client-to-client  # DISABLED

# Explicit exit notification for faster disconnection
explicit-exit-notify 1

# Optimize for low latency
# TCP_NODELAY equivalent for UDP
# (OpenVPN handles this automatically with UDP)

# Traffic shaping disabled for maximum speed
# (No bandwidth limits)
